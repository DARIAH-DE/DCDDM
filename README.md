# DCDDM
This paper specifies a data model for collection descriptions - the **D**ARIAH **C**ollection **D**escription **D**ata **M**odel (DCDDM). The main goal of this initiative is to assist institutions and individual scholars in creating descriptions of physical (or analogue) AND digital collections that can be read by humans as well as by machines. As far as basic concepts and parts of the text are concerned, this paper relies heavily on the [**D**ublin **C**ore **C**ollections **A**pplication **P**rofile (DCCAP)](http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/collection-application-profile/).
